 - **annotations**: contains the annotations we used for training & evaluation.
 - **partitions**: contains the partitions we used for each dataset. For training datasets, we provide cross-validation partitions (`8-fold-*.txt`). For SALAMI, these partitions do *not* contain any tracks from other datasets such as RWC, Beatles, or Queen. We also provide the exact partitions used in Tables 3 and 4. Again, we tried to make sure to remove any overlap (see the paper for details).
 - **predictions**: predictions obtained for each model.
